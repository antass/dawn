Motivation
============
This guide was inspired by the content and material presented in the `Johns Hopkins University <https://www.coursera.org/jhu>`_ *Data Analysis (Jan 22nd 2013)* massive open online course (MOOC) delivered via the `Coursera <https://www.coursera.org/>`_ platform. This was an applied statistics course focusing on data analysis. The course covered how to organize, perform, and write-up data analyses. For experienced statisticians this may be a basic skill, but for the layman a flexible pre-defined outline for tackling a data analysis project can serve as a handy tool.

Purpose
=========
Data analysis exercises are complex tasks comprised of many components and iterative process steps. Additionally, researchers are faced with the challenges of compliance with standard criteria for research reproducibility. This research template provides an exemplar to help guide a researcher during the iterative exploration of data.

Guide Details
=============

* rant_guide: The research template (.md, .html)
* rant_results: A write-up template  (.md, .html). Most research scientists, publish a synthesized report after a research project is complete. This outline provides a jump-start for that activity.
* sample/dap1: An example case study using the guide.
